            in this unit we did a lot of learning to code in Python, I found this difficult and had a hard time on the end-of-unit tests. I think this was because of the difficult nature of the code. It needed to be very specific and in a certain order to work. This is quite different from HTML which makes more sense and one line of code only affects one piece of a website.  <br><br>
            Programming in Python is not something that I am very good at or overly interested in getting better at. I'm glad that I gave it a go and now have a basic understanding of how the code is written.
