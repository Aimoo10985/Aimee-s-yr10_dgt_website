            Hello, I'm Aimee and I am a year 10 DGT student this is my website for the year, It'll have my progress and project from this year for you to look at. I am an aerilist and rower but i usually like to crochet and doing nothing. My favorite thing about Digi is making everything cute and fun, so hopefully you like my website, i'm very excited to do game design this year as well as animation.  <br><br>
            In year nine my favourite DGT project was making stickers, I made fair rat stickers. The rat had wings,a wand, and even some sparkles for extra pizzaz. <br><br> 
          I was having issues with making the photos below not stretch out so heres a collage that means they wont stretch.
